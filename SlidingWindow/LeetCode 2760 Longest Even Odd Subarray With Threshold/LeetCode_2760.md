# 🧠 Problem-Solving Journey: Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold

*Welcome to my coding newsletter where I break down LeetCode problems using the "Theory of Change" approach - working backwards from the goal to build a concrete solution.*

## 📋 Problem Overview

Today we're tackling **LeetCode 2760: Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold** - an Easy level problem that's perfect for understanding systematic problem-solving.

### The Challenge
We're given:
- A 0-indexed integer array `nums`
- An integer `threshold`

Our mission: Find the length of the longest subarray that satisfies these three conditions:
1. `nums[l] % 2 == 0` (starts with an even number)
2. For all indices i in range [l, r-1]: `nums[i] % 2 != nums[i+1] % 2` (alternating even/odd pattern)
3. For all indices i in range [l, r]: `nums[i] <= threshold` (all elements within threshold)

### Example Walkthrough
```python
nums = [3,2,5,4], threshold = 5
```

The longest valid subarray here is `[2,5,4]` with length 3:
- ✅ First constraint: `nums[l] = 2 % 2 == 0` (starts with even)
- ✅ Second constraint: `2%2 != 5%2` and `5%2 != 4%2` (alternating pattern)
- ✅ Third constraint: `2 ≤ 5`, `5 ≤ 5`, `4 ≤ 5` (all within threshold)

## 🎯 Applying Theory of Change

Instead of jumping straight into coding, let's work backwards from our goal:

### Ultimate Goal
Return the length of the longest possible subarray that satisfies all three constraints.

### How Do We Achieve This?
**You cannot achieve a goal you cannot clearly define.**

Let's break it down:
- **What is a subarray?** A contiguous block of elements from the original array
- **What constraints must we validate?** The three conditions mentioned above
- **How do we find the longest one?** Check all possible subarrays

### Strategic Approach
Given the problem constraints (array length ≤ 100), we can afford an O(n²) solution using a two-pointer sliding window approach.

## 🔍 Solution Development Process

### Step 1: Define Pointer Behavior

**Left Pointer (l):** 
- Range: 0 to n-1
- Purpose: Each position is a potential start of a valid subarray

**Right Pointer (r):**
- Range: l+1 to n
- Purpose: Extends the subarray as long as conditions hold

### Step 2: Identify Valid Starting Points

A valid starting point must satisfy:
- `nums[l] % 2 == 0` (even number)
- `nums[l] ≤ threshold` (within threshold)

**Key Insight:** If these conditions pass, we already have a valid subarray of length 1!

### Step 3: Extension Logic

For the right pointer starting at `r = l+1`:
- Check: `nums[r] ≤ threshold` (threshold condition)
- Check: `nums[r-1] % 2 ≠ nums[r] % 2` (alternating pattern)
- If both pass: extend the subarray and update length
- If either fails: break (cannot extend further from this starting point)

### Step 4: Track Maximum Length

Use a global variable `longest_len = 0` that gets updated whenever we find a longer valid subarray.

## 🏗️ Algorithm Structure

Here's the high-level logic flow:

```python
longest_len = 0

for l in range(n):  # Try each starting position
    # Check if nums[l] is a valid starting point
    if nums[l] <= threshold and nums[l] % 2 == 0:
        # We found a valid subarray of length 1
        current_len = 1
        longest_len = max(longest_len, current_len)
        
        # Try to extend this subarray
        for r in range(l + 1, n):
            # Check extension conditions
            if nums[r] <= threshold and nums[r-1] % 2 != nums[r] % 2:
                current_len = (r - l) + 1
                longest_len = max(longest_len, current_len)
            else:
                # Cannot extend further from this starting point
                break

return longest_len
```

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Systematic Decomposition:** Break the problem into core components (conditions, subarray definition)
2. **Condition Focus:** Keep all three constraints in mind throughout the solution
3. **Edge Case Awareness:** A single valid element forms a subarray of length 1
4. **Efficiency Balance:** O(n²) is acceptable given the constraints

## 🎯 Theory of Change in Action

This problem perfectly demonstrates the power of working backwards:

1. **Goal:** Find longest valid subarray length
2. **How?** Check all potential subarrays systematically  
3. **More concretely?** Iterate through all possible start points
4. **For each start?** If valid, extend right as long as conditions hold
5. **Track progress?** Maintain a maximum length variable

By applying this methodical approach, we transform a potentially overwhelming problem into a series of concrete, manageable steps.
