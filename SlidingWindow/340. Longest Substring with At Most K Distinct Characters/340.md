# LeetCode 340: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters - My Problem-Solving Journey

## Problem Statement

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most *k* distinct characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
```

## My Thought Process - Theory of Change Approach

Instead of jumping straight into code, I like to work backwards from the ultimate goal. Let me walk you through my thinking:

### Q: What is the Ultimate Goal Here?
The ultimate goal here is to find out the longest possible substring that validates a constraint.

### Q: What is the Constraint Here?
It needs to have at most k distinct elements. Mathematically speaking, it needs to have the number of unique elements within the substring â‰¤ k.

### Q: What is a Substring in the First Place?
A substring is a contiguous portion of the original string.

### Q: Do You See Any Familiar Pattern Here?
Yes, it's a problem of type "finding longest/shortest/k length substring that needs to validate certain constraints". So yeah, I see a pattern like sliding window can work fine here.

### Q: But Which Variation of Sliding Window Pattern You See Work Here?
I think I see a dynamic extending & shrinking pattern here, with left and right pointer.

### Q: So at High Level How You See the Algorithm Work?
We need to track the longest possible substring length, so I think a global variable like `max_length` can work fine here.

Also, we need to check the number of unique elements within each "current" substring. Initially, I thought a set data structure could work fine here, but after reflection, I realized we need something more sophisticated.

Now the tricky part is here - how the extending and shrinking part of pointer work:

1. First we need to initiate a left pointer to 0
2. Then the right pointer can be a standard pointer working in for loop: `for right in range(len(s)):`

### Q: Now Let's Focus on the Checking Part?
At high level, we shrink the window when we violate the constraint and we need to return to the validated state. But we don't know "exactly" how long it needs to wait for, so we wrap it within a while loop until we break from it. Inside it, we move the left pointer one step ahead each time.

### Q: How Does the Right Pointer Extend This Window?
It's simple - if we're under the constraint after the shrinking while loop, we keep updating the `current_len = (right - left) + 1` given we are within a valid range, and we update the `max_length = max(max_length, current_len)`.

## Technical Refinements

After working through my initial thought process, I realized some key refinements were needed:

### 1. Data Structure Choice
**Initial thought**: Use a `set` to track unique elements.
**Refinement**: Use a `HashMap/Dictionary` because:
- We need to count frequency of each character
- When shrinking, we need to know if removing a character completely eliminates it from the window
- A set only tells us presence, not frequency

### 2. Shrinking Logic Precision
**Initial thought**: Move left pointer and remove from set.
**Refinement**: 
- We shrink when `distinct_count > k`
- When moving left pointer, we decrement the frequency of `s[left]`
- If frequency becomes 0, we remove that character entirely from our HashMap

## Final Solution

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(s, k):
    """
    Find the length of the longest substring with at most k distinct characters.
    
    Args:
        s: Input string
        k: Maximum number of distinct characters allowed
    
    Returns:
        Length of the longest valid substring
    """
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    
    char_count = {}  # HashMap to track character frequencies
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Extend window: add current character
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
        
        # Shrink window when constraint violated
        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        # Update max length for current valid window
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Test cases
def test_solution():
    solution = lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct
    
    # Test case 1
    assert solution("eceba", 2) == 3, "Test case 1 failed"
    print("âœ… Test case 1 passed: 'eceba' with k=2 -> 3")
    
    # Test case 2
    assert solution("aa", 1) == 2, "Test case 2 failed"
    print("âœ… Test case 2 passed: 'aa' with k=1 -> 2")
    
    # Additional test cases
    assert solution("", 2) == 0, "Empty string test failed"
    assert solution("abcdef", 0) == 0, "k=0 test failed"
    assert solution("abcabcbb", 2) == 3, "Complex test failed"
    
    print("ðŸŽ‰ All test cases passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solution()
```

## Algorithm Analysis

**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string
- Each character is visited at most twice (once by right pointer, once by left pointer)

**Space Complexity**: O(min(m, k)) where m is the size of the character set
- In the worst case, we store at most k+1 characters in our HashMap

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **Theory of Change**: Working backwards from the goal helps identify the right approach before jumping into implementation.

2. **Data Structure Matters**: The choice between set and HashMap significantly impacts the solution's correctness.

3. **Sliding Window Pattern**: This problem perfectly demonstrates the "dynamic extending & shrinking" variant of sliding window.

4. **Edge Cases**: Always consider k=0, empty strings, and strings shorter than k.

## Personal Reflection

This problem taught me the importance of refining initial thoughts. My core intuition about sliding window was correct, but the implementation details needed refinement. The key breakthrough was realizing that frequency tracking (HashMap) was essential over simple presence tracking (set).

The "theory of change" approach - working backwards from the goal - helped me structure my thinking systematically rather than jumping into code immediately.
